*this series help me to understand more words out of my vocabulary and learn something about how the trial works*
*Sometimes you need to trust your lawyers as nuch as they say that they can win your case, if not they make sure that everything they have is given to win*
*I also learned that in a law firm they have a lot of cases to deal with, not just any cases but also lawyers that resigning, or going to other company. But they also have the non compete law which they can't go to rival firm or let say they are banned in the states they are in.*
